# Save-O-Clock

A simple screensaver in Python with the [TKinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) package, supports multiple monitors.
Displays a 24-hour clock (using [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font) in the center of the screen.
Closes on mouse movement or any keyboard input.

## Usage on Windows

In order to use this as an actual screensaver on Windows the Python code needs to be converted to an executable (or .src) file.
